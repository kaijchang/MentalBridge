# Mental Bridge based on Mental Poker

Purely educational Mental Bridge using a [mental poker library](https://github.com/kripod/mental-poker).

This project uses a NodeJS server to synchronize the players and relay the messages, but the server never holds secure information.

## Installation

Cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kajchang/mental-bridge.git
cd mental-bridge
```

Install all dependencies with `npm install`, and bundle the scripts with browserify with `npm run bundle`. Lastly, start the server with `npm start` and visit it at port 3000.
